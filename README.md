Developed with IntelliJ CE 2019.1

To start the JavaScript version, run the Gradle task "populateWebFolder" and open the file index.html in a Browser.

To start the Android Version, create a runtime configuration for an Android app with default values (choose MPP-Example as module)
and run this configuration.
